##Change theme

1. put theme button on side
2. change it so it looks like a little sphere
3. add mouseover text
4. reposition with resize
5. wire it to changeTheme function
6. change button color to dark if light is selected and vice versa
7. reorg code - init.js is no longer the best I think
8. button should change wrapper color, other button color, node and canvas color as well
9. remove rectangular select around button at clicking
10. bug: resize bar does not change color

- remove unnecessary library code
- define constants
